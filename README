it is a small program fordetrek type image conversion.
normally the data collected by the rigaku x-ray diffraction device is a detrek image, while this kind of data cannot be read by the imagej or other programs when you were trying to colleced powder diffraction  data.

Hence, I am going to develop a program that can convert the image to tif  format.
